## Hello

I am a software engineer working from the Minneapolis/Saint Paul area. I went to school at [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/) and I am originally from North Dakota.

I have experience working in many different technologies including (but not limited to) Go, Javascript, Python, Docker, K8s, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and AWS. When I find the time I like dabbling in writing shaders, WebGL, and learning about ray tracers.

While not doing the above, I enjoy biking and listening to podcasts.

### Projects
## [Noisy Terrain](https://github.com/petersbob/noisy-terrain)

A WebGL terrain generator using three terrain generation algorithms: value noise, Perlin noise, and the diamond-square algorithm.

I originally began this project while on a mission to learn WebGL. Everything is in plain WebGL and Javascript.

## [Musical Melee](https://github.com/petersbob/MusicalMelee)

I worked on this project with another St. Olaf student who created this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1wLshtOWsg) that got a lot of attention. We teamed up and are building the drumkit into melee itself.

## [4D Geometry viewer](https://github.com/StoDevX/humke-4d-geometry)

A web app to visualize the 2D, 3D, and 4D dimension built for St. Olaf professor [Paul Humke](https://www.stolaf.edu/people/humke/)'s course MATH 180 "A Brief Voyage to the 4th Dimension."
