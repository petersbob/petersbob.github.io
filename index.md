## Welcome

This is my personal website where I post some links and projects I have worked on.

My name is Joseph Peterson and I am an undergrad computer science student at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota.

I do a lot of python, javascript, and computer graphics work.

### Some Projects I Have Worked On

## [MME (Musical Melee)](https://github.com/petersbob/MME)

Some at my school created this video:

Then he decided to try and do it directly in melee. So we started [this](https://github.com/petersbob/MME) project.

I'm working on the programming to get data out of Melee and he is using the data to make music.

You can check out some really early progress here:

## [4D Geometry viewer](https://github.com/StoDevX/humke-4d-geometry)

I am working on a project with [omarshehata](https://github.com/omarshehata) on a geometry viewer for St. Olaf Professor Paul Humke for a geometry class he teaches.
