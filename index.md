## Hello

As a Software Engineer, I focus on building robust, scalable solutions that delight customers and solve complex business problems. I've worked in fintech and cybersecurity on a wide variety of tech stacks and projects. My technical expertise spans modern cloud-native architecture, leveraging Go, Python, and Javascript for development, and utilizing Kubernetes, Istio, Docker, AWS, PostgreSQL, and MySQL for deployment and persistence.

I thrive on technical challenges and am committed to mentorship and technical leadership, enjoying the process of guiding junior developers.

Outside of work, I enjoyed being involved in the local Twin Cities technology community in both hosting and attending various events. I also like road and gravel biking, comedy podcasts, and board games.

### A few personal projects I've worked on
## [Noisy Terrain](https://github.com/petersbob/noisy-terrain)

A WebGL terrain generator using three terrain generation algorithms: value noise, Perlin noise, and the diamond-square algorithm.

I originally began this project while on a mission to learn WebGL. Everything is in plain WebGL and Javascript.

## [Musical Melee](https://github.com/petersbob/MusicalMelee)

I worked on this project with another St. Olaf student who created this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1wLshtOWsg) that got a lot of attention. We teamed up and are building the drumkit into melee itself.

## [4D Geometry viewer](https://github.com/StoDevX/humke-4d-geometry)

A web app to visualize the 2D, 3D, and 4D dimension built for St. Olaf professor [Paul Humke](https://www.stolaf.edu/people/humke/)'s course MATH 180 "A Brief Voyage to the 4th Dimension."
