## Hello

I am a software engineer working for a fintech startup in Minneapolis. I went to school at [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/) and I am originally from North Dakota.

When I was little, I was really into art and cartoons/comics. By the end of high school, my interests had changed to technology. Now I spend a lot of time doing computer graphics, a best of both worlds. I am currently working with WebGL and GLSL. Also spend time programming in Javascript and Go.

While not doing the above, I enjoy listening to podcasts, watching movies, and being active (biking, running, etc).

A WebGL based program to play with a few terrain generation algorithms. It is still a work in progress, but most of the core functionality is already there.

## [Musical Melee](https://github.com/petersbob/MusicalMelee)

I worked on this project with another St. Olaf student who created this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1wLshtOWsg) that got a lot of attention. We teamed up and are building the drumkit into melee itself.

## [4D Geometry viewer](https://github.com/StoDevX/humke-4d-geometry)

A web app to visualize the 2D, 3D, and 4D dimension built for St. Olaf professor [Paul Humke](https://www.stolaf.edu/people/humke/)'s course MATH 180 "A Brief Voyage to the 4th Dimension."
