## Welcome

This is my personal website where I post some links and projects I have worked on.

My name is Joseph Peterson and I am an undergrad computer science student at St. Olaf College in Minnesota.

I do a lot of python, javascript and computer graphics work.

### Some Projects I Have Worked On

[MME (Musical Melee)] (https://github.com/petersbob/MME)

Some at my school created this video:

[![Musical Melee](https://img.youtube.com/vi/D1wLshtOWsg/0.jpg)] (https://youtu.be/D1wLshtOWsg)

Then he decided to try and do it directly in melee. So we started [this](https://github.com/petersbob/MME) project.

I'm working on the programming to get data out of Melee and he is using the data to make music.

You can check out some really early progress here:

### 4D Geometry viewer

I am working on a project with [omarshehata] (https://github.com/omarshehata) on a geometry viewer.

It allows you to view slices of objects in 2D, 3D, and 4D space.
